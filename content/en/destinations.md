Here is some advice!

### Bogotá

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Note: be careful with the altitude.** Bogotá is 2,600 m high: take it easy the first day, hydrate, and avoid too much alcohol until acclimatized.

#### Monserrate

Take the funicular or cable car up to Monserrate hill for sweeping views of Bogotá and the Andes at 3100 meters above the sea level. The sanctuary at the top is both spiritual and scenic, and the restaurants offer traditional cuisine. Best visited at sunset, when the city lights begin to twinkle.

#### Bogotá’s Gold Museum (Museo del Oro)

Housing over 55,000 pieces of pre-Hispanic gold, this is one of the world’s most dazzling collections. Each room tells stories of ancient craftsmanship, mythology, and rituals. It’s a fascinating glimpse into Colombia’s deep Indigenous heritage.

#### Museo Botero (Bogotá)

Dedicated to Colombia’s most famous artist, Fernando Botero, this museum displays his signature voluminous figures alongside works from Picasso, Dalí, and Monet. The museum is free and located in Bogotá’s historic La Candelaria district. It’s an inspiring stop for art lovers.

#### Urban & Modern Vibes

- Street Art Tours: Bogotá is one of the world’s street art capitals. Guided tours in La Candelaria reveal hidden political and cultural stories. 
- Usaquén: A colonial-style neighbourhood in the north, with a Sunday flea market, trendy restaurants, and leafy plazas. 
- Zona Rosa / Zona T: Nightlife hub with clubs, cocktail bars, and live music.

#### Markets & Food

- Paloquemao Market: A sensory overload of fruits, flowers, and street food. Great for tasting exotic Colombian produce like lulo, guanábana, or feijoa.
- Coffee & Chocolate Tours: Small roasteries in La Candelaria offer tastings and workshops.

#### Quick Getaways (day trip by car)

- Chingaza National Park: High-altitude páramo landscapes with frailejones (giant rosette plants that look almost otherworldly). You can spot spectacled bears, deer, and countless hummingbird species. The misty lagoons and moorlands feel mystical and uniquely Andean. About 1.5 hours from Bogotá.
- Laguna de Guatavita: Sacred lagoon tied to the legend of El Dorado. Surrounded by misty forests, 1.5 hours away.
- Zipaquirá Salt Cathedral: An underground cathedral carved into a salt mine, lit with dramatic colors. UNESCO-listed, about 1.5 hours away.

### Tourist highlights

#### Villa de Leyva

This Andean town boasts one of the largest cobblestone plazas in South America. White façades, red-tiled roofs, and a laid-back vibe make it a photogenic and peaceful retreat. Around it, you’ll find fossil museums, vineyards, and desert-like landscapes.

#### Cartagena de Indias

A walled city glowing with colonial charm, Cartagena mixes cobblestone streets, colorful balconies, and Caribbean sea views. The vibrant nightlife and nearby Rosario Islands make it perfect for both history lovers and beach seekers. Sunsets from the city walls are unforgettable.

#### Medellín

Once infamous, Medellín is now a model of urban innovation. Ride the cable cars up into the green hills and experience a city that blends modern art, lush gardens, and eternal spring weather. The festive lights in December are some of the most spectacular in Latin America.

### Nature and adventure

#### Tayrona National Park

A slice of paradise on the Caribbean coast, Tayrona offers jungle trails that open to white-sand beaches framed by giant boulders. Monkeys and toucans often cross your path, adding to the wild atmosphere. It’s best to spend at least a night in ecohuts or hammocks to really absorb it.

#### San Gil (Adventure Capital)

Perfect for adrenaline seekers, San Gil is Colombia’s hub for rafting, caving, paragliding, and waterfall rappelling. The town itself is small and charming, making it an ideal base to test your adventurous side. November–December are good months since the rivers are still flowing but rain is less heavy.

#### Valle de Cocora (Salento)

Home to Colombia’s towering wax palms, the tallest palm trees in the world. This valley feels like stepping into a dream. Mist drifts through the Andean mountains while bright green hills roll endlessly. It’s a paradise for hikers and photographers alike.

##### Santuario de Fauna y Flora Otún Quimbaya (near Pereira)

A birdwatcher’s paradise: red howler monkeys, toucans, and more than 300 bird species thrive here. Trails wind through cloud forest rich in orchids and bromeliads. It’s accessible yet feels remote and wild.

##### Los Nevados National Park

High-altitude páramos, snow-capped volcanoes, and glacial lagoons await in this Andean park. Hikes here combine surreal landscapes with Colombia’s unique mountain ecology. On clear days, you can see several volcanic peaks shining at once.

##### Leticia

Leticia, Colombia’s Amazon gateway at the border with Peru and Brazil, is best reached by flight from Bogotá. Expect rainforest wildlife (pink dolphins, Indigenous communities, canopy views) and rainy season conditions in Nov–Dec (mud, mosquitoes, high rivers). For safety reasons, stick to organized tours and carry your ID/passport for border crossings.

#### Amacayacu National Park (Amazon, near Leticia)

If choosing the Amazon route, this is the place: pink dolphins, giant lilies, caimans, and monkeys everywhere. It’s rainforest immersion, best with local guides. November–December are wetter, but rivers are full and transport easier.
