**FADE IN**

_NARRATOR (deep, poetic tone)_

"All love stories begin with destiny… with timing written in the stars…"

SFX: the sound of a tape rewinding, clunky and abrupt.

_NARRATOR (snapping out of it, lighter)_

"but not this one. These two did not collide in a bustling street. There was no dramatic chase at a train station. No mix-up at the airport. And, Lord ,oh Lord! they did not swipe right on an app."

**CUT TO – INT. DINNER WITH FRIENDS – EVENING**

A lively table. Two people lean in, smiling, laughing, batting their eyelashes... like it’s subtle! Everyone else at the table sees exactly what’s happening.

_FRIEND (whispering to themselves with a grin):_

"They belong together... I have a plan."

**FREEZE FRAME.**

_NARRATOR (smiling):_

"And that’s how this fairy tale began."

**FADE OUT**

**MONTAGE – VARIOUS**

– DECEMBER. First date at Christmas. Fairy lights glow. She talks fast, he can't stop grinning.

– EUROPE. An Airbnb disaster. Too many stairs, 40C, not enough cooling, an abominable sofa bed. They sleep cuddling on the floor.

– CURFEW NIGHT. A tango instructor from across the world explains how to walk on a square. They stumble awkward and uncoordinated, but end up with a cheeky smile. 

– TREASURE HUNT. She comes home from a long trip. She solves the clues he made for her and finds a lovely gift.

– A MAN'S STRUGGLE. He gets the flu, barely hanging to life. She makes soup and cuddles him. His tail is wagging.

– PETS. One becomes two. Two becomes three. Each arrival, one holds the bird, the other beams like they've won the lottery.

– BUDGET COMMITTEE. Laptops open, tabs multiplying, both frowning. Under the table, he caresses her feet. They breathe and sip on their tea.

_NARRATOR (wry, soft):_

"Not a grand drama. Just the ordinary moments — unforgettable together."

**EXT. ENCHANTED FOREST – WEDDING DAY**

Trees overhead, lights strung like stars. Family and friends gathered, the same ones who once watched two people flirt across a dinner table, or any other scene of this story.

The couple steps forward. A pause. A smile. A promise.

_NARRATOR (warm, certain):_

"Every story has its twists, its stumbles, its laughter. This is the one we choose every day."

**FADE OUT.**

**THE END.**

_(Only on paper. Love doesn't do endings, only days worth remembering.)_

Not all the scenes are exclusively ours.

Along the way, family and friends added their lines and their colours. If you hold this invitation, it's because you shape us and our history.

Without your part, this movie would've never been made.
