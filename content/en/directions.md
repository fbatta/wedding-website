## Directions

### 🚗 By car from Bogotá

Whether you’re driving your own car or taking a taxi or Uber, you will need to get onto Route 50 (toll road) towards “El Rosal”.

After about 20kms on Route 50, take the exit called “Via San Jose a El Rosal”.

Soon you’ll find yourself at El Rosal. From there, turn right onto the main road (Calle 10 Subachoque-El Rosal) and follow the road for about 10kms. After that, the venue will be on your right.

Note that, if you’re using Google Maps or Waze, phone reception can be a bit spotty on the way there, so make sure you either download maps for offline use, or check the whole itinerary in advance.

If you see an intersection with a statue of the virgin Mary on top of some blue cement blocks you’ve gone too far and you need to come back a bit!
