# Hacienda Montecano - Esencia de Bodas

The wedding ceremony and reception followed by dinner will take place at the Hacienda Montecano Esencia de Bodas in Subachoque, about 2 hours away from Bogot√°, the capital city of Colombia.

## Directions

### By car from Bogot√°

Whether you‚Äôre driving your own car or taking a taxi or Uber, you will need to get onto Route 50 (toll road) towards ‚ÄúEl Rosal‚Äù.

After about 20kms on Route 50, take the exit called ‚ÄúVia San Jose a El Rosal‚Äù.

Soon you‚Äôll find yourself at El Rosal. From there, turn right onto the main road (Calle 10 Subachoque-El Rosal) and follow the road for about 10kms. After that, the venue will be on your right.

Note that, if you‚Äôre using Google Maps or Waze, phone reception can be a bit spotty on the way there, so make sure you either download maps for offline use, or check the whole itinerary in advance.

If you see an intersection with a statue of the virgin Mary on top of some blue cement blocks you‚Äôve gone too far and you need to come back a bit!
