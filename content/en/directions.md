## Directions

### 🚌  By public transport

Unfortunately, there's no practical way to get to the location by public transport.

### 🚗 By car from Bogotá

If you’re driving, you will need to get onto Route 50 (toll road) towards “El Rosal”.

After about 20kms on Route 50, take the exit called “Via San Jose a El Rosal”.

Soon you’ll find yourself at El Rosal. From there, turn right onto the main road (Calle 10 Subachoque-El Rosal) and follow the road for about 10kms. After that, the venue will be on your right.

Note that, if you’re using Google Maps or Waze, phone reception can be a bit spotty on the way there, so make sure you either download maps for offline use, or check the whole itinerary in advance.

The venue has an ample parking area, you will have no issues finding a spot.

If you see an intersection with a statue of the virgin Mary on top of some blue cement blocks you’ve gone too far and you need to come back a bit!

Please consider that the traffic can be very high, and depending on where you are in Bogotá it might take up to 2.5 hours to reach the venue!

### 🥳 By event bus / 🚙 carpooling

If you indicate in the RSVP that you need transport. we will contact you via WhatsApp. There are two options, we can put you in contact with someone who has spare seats (if you are comfortable with it) or we can save you a seat in the event bus.

The event bus will be leaving from a central location near to our proposed hotel and two buses will come back to that same location at two different times of the night. If you decide to stay in our recommended hotel, easy-peasy! If not, we advise arranging an uber from there to your accommodation/house.
