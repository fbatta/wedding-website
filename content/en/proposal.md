_"For small creatures such as we, the vastness is bearable only through love"_ - Carl Sagan / book by his daughter Sasha Sagan.

This quote reminds us of what it means to be human: our lives swing between joy, monotony, pain, pleasure, grief, and beauty. It all feels so vast, and yet, we are only specks of stardust. A hard truth, especially for us who don’t believe in an afterlife.

Still, being here in this moment, laughing, loving, finding wonder in the smallest things is worth celebrating. We chose to marry to immortalize a fleeting breath of the universe into a ritual, celebrating our lives and the lives of our loved ones.

_Our wedding is not a beginning_

_we’ve been together for six years._

_It’s not a new commitment_

_We’ve already climbed, stumbled, and carried on through the very highs and the scary lows._

_It’s not the reunion of two halves_

_we are two wholes, walking side by side._

_But it is_

_a collision of families into a new magical galaxy,_

_a celebration of the happy accidents that brought us together,_

_a ritual to treasure and make sense of the passing of time._

_It is for survival,_

_that we love…_

_madly_
