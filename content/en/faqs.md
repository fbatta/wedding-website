#### What date should I RSVP by?

Please RSVP as soon as possible after receiving the invitation. The deadline is **October 26th, 2025**.

## 🏞️ Venue

#### What time should I arrive at your wedding ceremony?

Please arrive by 3.00PM, as the ceremony will start soon after.

#### What is the easiest way to get to and from your wedding venue?

All the information is available in the [directions](/directions) page.

#### Is there parking available near your wedding venue?

Yes, parking is available within the venue grounds.

#### Will your wedding be indoors or outdoors?

Our wedding ceremony will be held outdoors and the place is a bit chilly. So, please bring appropriate coats. After the Cocktail hour, we will find shelter from the cold indoors and there will be chimeneys.

## 🛌 Accommodation

#### Will you be providing rooms for the guests?

No. Unfortunately, we can not help with this but we have some good recommendations. If you specify that you need this, we'll contact you to arrange.

#### Will you be providing transport from hotels to the wedding venue?

Yes! See instructions [here](/direction).

## 🤵 Dress Code

This isn’t your usual wedding. We want it colourful, sparkly, and full of energy!

#### Style (suggestion)

Long or midi dresses, cocktail dresses, jumpsuits, or two-piece suits: all are good. Suits with a tie or bowtie work too.

#### Colours (non-negotiable!)

Dresses: any colour or style that you love is perfect, as long as it's not black, white or cream.

Shirts (for anyone wearing one): please make them bold and bright: think Carnival. Plain black or plain white are out.

Suits: colourful suits are especially encouraged. Black, dark gray or dark blue feel too somber for the night. However, if that's what you already own, that's fine. The shirt and accessories will brighten it up.

### Personal touch

Always wanted to wear sequins, metallics, rhinestones, glitter, or something outrageous to a wedding? This is the moment. Sparkles are not just allowed, they’re encouraged. We want the whole room to shimmer.

#### Practical note

The ceremony is on grass, and evenings here are cold (9–15 °C). Bring a coat, but once we’re indoors and dancing it’ll heat up fast.

## 🍝 Food

#### What type of food will be served at your wedding?

All our food is vegetarian. Please specify additional requirements or allergies when RSVPing.

## 🗺️ Itinerary

#### What is the wedding day itinerary?

It will be shared here soon!

#### What time will your wedding reception end?

It is programmed to finish around 1 am, but we will arrange transport at at least two turns in case people want to return to their hotel/home early.

#### Will there be a time gap between your wedding ceremony and reception?

Nope, straight to the cocktail.

## 📸 Media

#### Can I post wedding photos on social media?

Yes, please feel free to do so.

#### Will you be live streaming your wedding?

Yes, please check this page to watch the event on your device.
