## ✈️ Travel information

#### Do I need a visa to travel to Colombia?

You can check out visa requirements at [this link](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/tramites_servicios/visa/lista-a-b-c).

#### Any necessary paperwork?

Foreigners and national alike are required to fill in the Check-MIG form within 72 hours of entering Colombia. You can find the form [here](https://apps.migracioncolombia.gov.co/pre-registro/en).

#### What vaccines are required/recommended?

There are no vaccines required to enter Colombia. However, if you're planning to travel anywhere away from the big cities, it's recommended to get the [Yellow fever](https://www.minsalud.gov.co/salud/publica/PET/Paginas/Fiebre-amarilla.aspx) vaccine at least 10 days prior to visiting these areas. Vaccination hubs are present in various parts of Bogotá, and vaccinations are generally free of charge.

The UK's National Health Service has a [very comprehensive page](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/53/colombia#Vaccine_Recommendations) that lists all the health recommendations.

#### Safety recommendations

Avoid displaying valuables. Use taxis or ride-hailing apps. Especially, it is preferred not to walk around alone at night. In Bogotá, it is easy to use the public transport but avoid peak hours because is too crowded.

Stick to daylight visits in historic centers.

Always use official guides for remote/nature areas.

Colombia’s festive season means lots of events and nightlife — enjoy, but keep an eye on drinks and belongings.

If you've got more questions, you can visit the Australian Government's Smarttraveller [travel advisory for Colombia](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/colombia).

#### Methods of payment

Colombia operates largely with cash: taxis and certain shops will not usually accept any credit/debit cards, so make sure you travel with some cash on you. The minimum tariff for a taxi is 7.500 COP, with an average ride within the city costing between 15 and 20k COP.

Also, try not to pay with 50.000 COP banknotes, because people often don't have change for those.

#### Public transport

Bogotá has a network of buses, called Transmilenios, which cover most of the city. Tickets can be bought at authorised sellers all around the city.

## 🛌 Accommodation

#### Will you be providing rooms for the guests?

No. Unfortunately, we can not help with this, but we have some good recommendations. If you specify that you need this, we'll reach out to you to arrange.

#### Will you be providing transport from hotels to the wedding venue?

Yes! See instructions [here](/direction).

## 🤵 Dress Code

Our wedding is a formal event. We look forward to seeing you with your best outfit and your biggest smile! 

#### Style (suggestion)

Long or midi dresses, jumpsuits, two-piece suits or cocktail dresses: all are welcome. Suits with a tie or bowtie as per your preference.

#### Colours (non-negotiable!)

Dresses: any colour or style that you love is perfect, as long as it's not black, white or cream.

Shirts (for anyone wearing one): please make them bold and bright: think Carnival. Plain black or plain white are out.

Suits: colourful suits are especially encouraged. Black, dark gray or dark blue feel too somber for the night. However, if that's what you already own, that's fine. The shirt and accessories will brighten it up.

#### Personal touch

Always wanted to wear sequins, metallics, rhinestones, glitter, or something outrageous to a wedding? This is the moment. Sparkles are not just allowed, they’re encouraged. We want the whole room to shimmer.

#### Practical note

The ceremony is on grass, and evenings here are cold (9–15 °C). Bring a coat, but once we’re indoors and dancing it’ll heat up fast.

## 🍝 Food

#### What type of food will be served at your wedding?

All our food is vegetarian. Please specify additional requirements or allergies when RSVPing.
